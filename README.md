# GradeCalculator

A simple project to help me learn C#. In short: I saw [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/guided-project-calculate-final-gpa/4-exercise-calculate-sum) and wondered how I could make it better.

A significant amount of the code is just comments, by the way. Don't expect anything fancy. I may know TypeScript, but that says nothing about my skills at other langs.
